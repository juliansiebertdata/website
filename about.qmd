> Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty. - Jacob Bronowski

Here we are. My first Quarto website. For now, I'm going to use it as a place to put my notes and thoughts, to save them for later and share them with you. I'm not sure what I'll do with it in the future, but I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go.

If you have stumbled upon this site somehow, I hope you find something useful. But keep in mind that this is a work in progress. Right now I am writing my bachelor thesis in Data Science for Biology. So there's still a lot to learn and I'll make mistakes along the way.

As I'm not a native English speaker, there will be a lot of mistakes in my writing. I'm sorry for that. I'm trying to improve my English and I hope you can bear with me.

The program I use to write this is called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It's a great tool for writing reproducible documents, presentations, websites, manuscripts and more. If you want to know more about Quarto, check out the great [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/) website.

## Topics

I am currently working as a working student in the R&D team of a young biotech start-up. I'm also a student of plant sciences at the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabrück, Germany. Reproducible research, data science and plant biology are my main interests and these are the topics I will mostly write about.

If you happen to be interested in these topics too, come along on my journey and let's see where it takes us.

## Structure

The Website is structured into different sections and chapters. You can navigate through the chapters using the navigation bar on the left side of the page. Fell free to explore and contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

About
: This is the section you are currently reading. It contains some general information about the idea behind and the structure of this website.

A new world
: In this section we will explore some of the basics of working with data in various forms. It is by no means a complete guide to data science, but it will enable us to work with real data. For example, the spreadsheet your colleague sends you to analyse.
(If you are just starting out, I highly recommend the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by H. Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund) @hadley2024

First Steps
: Having explored the world of data, we make our first steps towards extracting meaningful information from it. We will learn how to use the R programming language to analyse data and create visualisations. Therefor we use the R package `tidyverse`, a collection of packages designed for data science. In the second part of this section, we'll explore what can happen if we don't pay attention to the details of our data, and how we can avoid these problems.

Expeditions
: This is where I discuss topics and particular use cases that I stumble upon. It is a collection of notes, real world examples and thoughts on various topics in a blog format.


## Meet the team

Fortunately, we don't have to travel alone. I'm lucky to have a great team of people around me to explore basic and advanced topics in data science and plant biology. Let me introduce them to you:

<strong class="co-name">The Neinhorn</strong>

Mixup of "Nein" (german for "No") and "Einhorn" (german for "Unicorn") 
The Neinhorn (NO!Unicorn) is a creative and curious creature which likes to behave different than others. We will meet it along our journey and it might make things difficult for us from time to time. Inspired by *Marc-Uwe Klings Book* "Das NEINhorn" @kling2021

<strong class="co-name">The Maulwurf</strong>

Maulwurf is german for "Mole" the german word Maul*en* also translates to "grouse" and this describes our Maulwurf pretty well. It likes to put his nose deep into every topic and wants to know how things work and why they work the way they do. It also grouses a lot if we make shortcuts to get things done.
