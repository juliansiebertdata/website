Sadly for us, and the data itself, it is also the most common way to store data in a way that is not useful for analysis. We will get into that later.",

For now, I’m going to use it as a place to put my notes and thoughts, to save them for later and share them with you. I’m not sure what I’ll do with it in the future, but I’m sure I’ll figure it out as I go.\nIf you have stumbled upon this site somehow, I hope you find something useful. But keep in mind that this is a work in progress. Right now I am writing my bachelor thesis in Data Science for Biology. So there’s still a lot to learn and I’ll make mistakes along the way.\nAs I’m not a native English speaker, there will be a lot of mistakes in my writing. I’m sorry for that. I’m trying to improve my English and I hope you can bear with me.\nThe program I use to write this is called Quarto. It’s a great tool for writing reproducible documents, presentations, websites, manuscripts and more. If you want to know more about Quarto, check out the great documentation website.",

We will meet it along our journey and it might make things difficult for us from time to time.

It likes to put his nose deep into every topic and wants to know how things work and why they work the way they do. It also grouses a lot if we make shortcuts to get things done.\nThe Mole, Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported)",

A step which is offen referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA).\nLuckily we have a toolset at our hand called the grammar of graphics (ggplot).\nWe will use the tidyverse suite of packages for this. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The tidyverse is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the tidyverse in a single command. The packages in the tidyverse have been designed to work together naturally. This means that you can fluidly move from one package to another. For example, you might start with dplyr to manipulate your data, then ggplot2 to plot it, then gganimate to animate it.\n\n\n\n Back to top",
