For now, I’m going to use it as a place to put my notes and thoughts, to save them for later and share them with you. I’m not sure what I’ll do with it in the future, but I’m sure I’ll figure it out as I go.\nIf you have stumbled upon this site somehow, I hope you find something useful. But keep in mind that this is a work in progress. Right now I am focussing on my master’s degree in Plant Sciences. So there’s still a lot to learn and I’ll make mistakes along the way.\nAs I’m not a native English speaker, there will be a lot of mistakes in my writing. I’m sorry for that. I’m trying to improve my English and I hope you can bear with me.\nThe program I use to write this is called Quarto. It’s a great tool for writing reproducible documents, presentations, websites, manuscripts and more. If you want to know more about Quarto, check out the great documentation website.",

She/He is lucky to have a great team of people around her/him to explore basic and advanced topics in data science and plant biology. Let me introduce them to you:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Neinhorn\nMixup of “Nein” (german for “No”) and “Einhorn” (german for “Unicorn”) The Neinhorn (NO!Unicorn) is a creative and curious creature which likes to behave different than others. We will meet it along our journey and it might make things difficult for us from time to time. Inspired by Marc-Uwe Klings Book “Das NEINhorn” Kling (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Maulwurf\nMaulwurf is german for “Mole” the german word Maulen also translates to “grouse” and this describes our Maulwurf pretty well. It likes to put his nose deep into every topic and wants to know how things work and why they work the way they do. It also grouses a lot if we make shortcuts to get things done.\n\n\n\nStorage\n\nStatistical Learning in R with the video Courses here\nStorytelling with Data\nexperimental designs",
