title: The Planet of Data
---

Data comes in many shapes and forms (yes even colors). In this section we will get into the world of data to explore and understand it.

The most common living place of data you will come across is the spreadsheet. Since the introduction of the spreadsheet in the 1980s, it has become the most common way to store data. Sadly for us, and the data itself, it is also the most common way to store data in a way that is not useful for analysis. We will get into that later.
