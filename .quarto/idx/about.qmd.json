My first Quarto website. For now, I'm going to use it as a place to put my notes and thoughts, to save them for later and share them with you. I'm not sure what I'll do with it in the future, but I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go.\n\nIf you have stumbled upon this site somehow, I hope you find something useful.

So there's still a lot to learn and I'll make mistakes along the way.\n\nAs I'm not a native English speaker, there will be a lot of mistakes in my writing. I'm sorry for that. I'm trying to improve my English and I hope you can bear with me.\n\nThe program I use to write this is called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It's a great tool for writing reproducible documents, presentations, websites, manuscripts and more.

You can navigate through the chapters using the navigation bar on the left side of the page. Fell free to explore and contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.\n\nAbout\n: This is the section you are currently reading. It contains some general information about the idea behind and the structure of this website.\n\nAgricultural Research\n: This section is dedicated to exploring various aspects of agricultural research, including methodologies, case studies, and the advancements in the field. As a narrative thread, we will follow the journey of a newly hired researcher as she/he navigates the challenges of conducting impactful research in a young agricultural biotechnology company.\n\n## Meet the team\n\nFortunately, our main character doesnt have to navigate this journey alone. She/He is lucky to have a great team of people around her/him to explore basic and advanced topics in data science and plant biology.
